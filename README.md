# Work done 

Image in here was taken from:

1. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NUTS_3_regions_of_Scotland_map.svg (2.92 MB)
2. edited to remove the numerical legends for 33 localities
3. That shown in a browser
4. screen-capped back to png (125 KB, 676 x 900 pixels)
5. Taken into a PNG to SVG tracing tool with "extra smoothing turned on"
6. That SVG fixed up by hand quite a bit - layering, some deletes where what was deleted wasn't apparent to the eye (353 KB, 144KB zipped)
7. Handed to ChatGPT's "GPT4o" LLM for additional path simplification (246 KB, 93 KB zipped). 

TODO: the navy blue coastline is also between localities inland too and should not be. Or it shouldn't be blue. 
Those inland gaps could be simplified with squares and ovals that are behind the locality outlines. I have commented 
out the shapes at the end of the svg file so they can't be seen, but ideally I would ask an AI to remove sections of 
the coastline (ID) that are coinciding with the gaps-between-localities (ID). Sept 2024: AIs are considering this task 
took big.
